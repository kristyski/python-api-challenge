###Python API Challenge Homework



The WeatherPy code selects over 500 latitude and longitude coordinates, at random . It then calls on the OpenWeatherAPI to return the nearest city.

Then it produces visuals including 4 scatter plots showing relationships between latitude and maximum temperature, humidity, cloudiness and wind speed. 

Next it divides the northern from southern hemisphere and compares the above on and 8 linear regression plots.



Observable Trends
As anticipated, maximum temperature is greater nearer the equator.

At least at this time of year, humidity and cloudiness do not show a strong correlation to latitude.
Wind speed in the Northern hemisphere seems more predictable than in the Southern.
